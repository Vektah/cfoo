Features
----------
More tests for EL parsing
Spaces in EL?
Allow lone dollar signs in strings? (escaping is only necessary if the dollar is in front of a bracket)
Shorthand for AWS variables (e.g. { "Ref" : "AWS::StackId" } ) 
Allow arrays as function args (e.g. $(Join("", [1,2,3])))
Put function names in a constant
Better errors when parsing fails
    - Parslet output is good, but check how much we can improve it by refactoring the parser
Split into resources/mappings/parameters/etc by putting templates into directories with those names
Allow directory for raw templates
Allow traditional JSON CloudFormation templates (including modules, splitting, etc)
Expose parser, for use with Fog (github fog/fog)
Vim highlighting
Use multi-json instead of json gem (spec.add_dependency 'multi_json', '~> 1.0')
Disablable warnings about naming conventions
Allow module references to remote templates (inc. Git repositories) (auto-included)
Allow rendering only part of the project (in case part of the infrastructure already exists)
Render templates with ERB to allow extra flexibility/substitution
Resolve EL and complain/fail if targets don't exist
