Features
----------
YAML types for everything!
EL shorthand for AWS variables (e.g. { "Ref" : "AWS::StackId" } ) 
Add Fn::GetAZs
Better map shorthand, for when one map key is a reference (e.g. { "Fn::FindInMap": [ "AWSRegion2AMI", { "Ref" : "AWS::Region" }, "AMI" ] })
Better errors when parsing fails
Split project into modules (arbitrary logical components: e.g. VPC, Mail Server, Puppet)
Split into resources/mappings/parameters/etc by putting templates into directories with those names
Allow directory for raw templates
Allow traditional JSON CloudFormation templates (including modules, splitting, etc)
Disablable warnings about naming conventions
Allow module references to remote templates (inc. Git repositories) (auto-included)
Allow rendering only part of the project (in case part of the infrastructure already exists)
Render templates with ERB to allow extra flexibility/substitution
Resolve EL and complain/fail if targets don't exist

Bugs
----------
Parsing fails for EL in EL (e.g. "$(Map.$(KeyName)[Value])"). Do we need a real parser?
